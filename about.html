                Children are ‘stars’ – we just have to wait and in a magical moment we notice a twinkle and they sparkle – like tiny stars that illumine our lives.

                Caelum High School started with a purpose. The management of Step by Step Nursery school which started in the year 1996 wanted to groom children to be the future citizens of a developed nation and was not willing to send them to other institutes. There was a will and so we found a way.
            </p>
            <p>
                After managing a nursery school from 1996 to 2010 we were ready to step up – to start standard 1 in our old premises at 64/4 Ghorpadi.

                Aryama Education Foundation started Caelum High School with the same management in 2010, adding a class every year. We are now in our new campus situated at 20/1-6 Undri, where along-with academic subjects required by ICSE we also enjoy extra-curricular activities to bring about all round development of our children.
